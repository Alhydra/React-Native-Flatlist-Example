My name is Youssef el habchi, from [rn-master.com](https://rn-master.com) I welcome each and everyone of you.


Hello again, I welcome each and everyone of you. In this article, we will go through the process of making a example react native flatlist.

As flatlists are vital parts of almost every app nowadays, The List view.  
Which can go from a flatlist of your contacts, to your entire app feed.

Feel free to read the whole article on my blog [React Native Flatlist Example](https://rn-master.com/react-native-flatlist-example/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an expo project, check it from  [Expo.io](https://exp.host/@alhydra/react-native-flatlist-example)
